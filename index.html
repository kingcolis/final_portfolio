                <h2>King Colis</h2>
                <p>Greetings! I am King Aguiluz B. Colis, 
                    a first-year college student at Ateneo de Naga University. 
                    I embarked on the journey of Computer Science with the intent 
                    of immersing myself in the intricate world of coding languages, 
                    embracing the challenges that come with this dynamic field. 
                    As a passionate learner, I am eager to explore various programming 
                    languages, seeking to broaden my knowledge and sharpen my problem-solving 
                    skills. Beyond the realm of academia, I find solace and excitement in 
                    the world of gaming. Games such as Dota 2, Valorant, League of Legends, 
                    Counter-Strike Global Offensive 1 and 2.0 have become a significant 
                    part of my leisure time. Engaging in these virtual landscapes not only 
                    serves as a form of entertainment but also fosters strategic thinking, 
                    teamwork, and quick decision-making â€” skills that complement my academic 
                    pursuits. The balance between my academic endeavors and gaming escapades 
                    enriches my overall college experience, allowing me to thrive both 
                    intellectually and recreationally.

                    each accompanied by a cast of unforgettable heroes and characters. 
                    These digital realms have become a canvas for my gaming adventures,
                    and among the myriad of protagonists and allies, a select few have
                    etched a lasting place in my heart as favorites.

                    <div class="text">Yone is portrayed as a skilled swordsman and is associated with a rich lore that delves into the mystical and fantastical world of Runeterra, where the game is set. Yone's story is intricately woven with themes of honor, betrayal, and supernatural elements, making him a compelling character in the League of Legends narrative.

                        In terms of gameplay, Yone is typically categorized as a melee assassin, emphasizing his agility and prowess with a blade. Players can expect a combination of swift, precise attacks and powerful, supernatural abilities when controlling Yone in the game.
                        
                        For the most accurate and up-to-date information on Yone, including any changes or additions to the character, I recommend checking the official League of Legends website or in-game resources for the latest details. The gaming landscape is dynamic, and new content and updates are regularly introduced to keep the experience fresh for players.</div>

                    <div class="text">Invoker is a highly complex and versatile spellcaster within the Dota 2 universe. What sets Invoker apart is his unique ability to combine and invoke a vast array of spells from three distinct elements: Quas (representing ice), Wex (representing air), and Exort (representing fire). The combination of these elements allows Invoker to access ten different spells, making him one of the most adaptable and strategic heroes in the game.

                        His intricate playstyle requires a deep understanding of the game mechanics and a keen sense of timing. Players controlling Invoker need to be adept at combining his various spells to suit different situations, whether it's dealing damage, controlling the battlefield, or providing utility to the team.</div>
